# openCASp - an open source passive Collision Avoidance System 

The openCASp is developed as an AI/ML practical use case for the XANDAR project. It is built upon the open source code from Stanford Intelligence Systems Laboratory (SISL) called [VerticalCAS](https://github.com/sisl/VerticalCAS) and [HorizontalCAS](https://github.com/sisl/HorizontalCAS). The underlying publication can be seen [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.07084.pdf).

With Horizontal- and VerticalCAS as a basis, this working group is modifying the code to improve performance, reliablity, dependability and robustness. 

## Current openCASp version  
Here you can find a mdzip file with the current openCASp version. Mdpzip is the data format of the tool Cameo Systems Modeller. There has been no _good_ way to make it usable for other application, this is only usable if you have Cameo yourself (used version: 19.0 SP3). We are working on a more open source solution.

## Web application (work in progress)
If you do not have Cameo Systems Modeller and no general solution has been found yet, you can still look at the model via a web application. You cannot modify this! It is solely for getting an insight.
